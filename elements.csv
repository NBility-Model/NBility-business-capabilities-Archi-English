"id-f9059b26cc89413eae691a04bdf8e9fb","ArchimateModel","NBility-business-capabilities-EN","NBility is a comprehensive capability model esigned specifically for grid operators. Its purpose is to streamline collaboration within the utility sector, including interactions between grid operators and their suppliers or advisors. The model comprises three main components: a capability model, an associated business object model, and a value stream model, all of which work together to enhance operational efficiency and communication.

The maintenance and development of the NBility model are overseen by the Dutch Distribution System Operators (EDSN). Additionally, the formation of a User Group is underway, which aims to foster a community where NBility users can share insights, experiences, and propose enhancements to the model.

The NBility model is available under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License (CC-BY-4.0), allowing for widespread use and adaptation within the guidelines of this license.

For further information, resources, and updates on the NBility model, please visit our websites at https://www.edsn.nl/nbility-model/ and https://github.com/NBility-Model. These platforms provide comprehensive details and access to the model, facilitating its adoption and implementation within the utility sector.",""
